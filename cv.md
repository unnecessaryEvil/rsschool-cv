3. I happen to love code, both the process of writing it and the thing itself. So, my aim is to basically learn to code, get a job and do the thing I love professionally. I don't have any work experience at the moment, though this will hopefully change sometime soon; for now, I focus on my studies and learning new things: mostly code-related, but I also enjoy studying spoken languages and physics. My best traits, in my opinion, are adaptability, curiosity and desire to learn.
4. Somewhat competent with Python, NumPy and Pandas. Have a grasp on HTML and CSS. Currently learning JavaScript and C.

3. I happen to love code, both the process of writing it and the thing itself. So, my aim is to basically learn to code, get a job and do the thing I love professionally. I don't have any work experience at the moment, though this will hopefully change sometime soon; for now, I focus on my studies and learning new things: mostly code-related, but I also enjoy studying spoken languages and physics. My best traits, in my opinion, are adaptability, curiosity and desire to learn.
4. Somewhat competent with Python, NumPy and Pandas. Have a grasp on HTML and CSS. Currently learning JavaScript and C.
5. > Write a function that accepts an array of 10 integers (between 0 and 9), that returns a string of those numbers in the form of a phone number.
``` javascript
function createPhoneNumber(numbers){
  let number = "";
  number += "(";
  for (let i = 0; i <= 2; i++){
    number += numbers[i];
  };
  number += ") ";
  for (let i = 3; i <= 5; i++){
    number += numbers[i];
  };
  number += "-";
  for (let i = 6; i <= 9; i++){
    number += numbers[i];
  };
  return number;
}
```
